I wasn't really interested, but it was one of the more interesting options I had. Well, I'm glad I made the right choice! I started reading it last night and I haven't put it down since.If you love food and a little romance, which I am both fond of, it's an excellent book to read.

Her character is so underdeveloped- we know she's studying art history, and she enjoys Bruno's cooking with a passion. That's about it. And Tomasso, he's just the cliché for any over-sexed Mediterranean male who encounters foreign females.It's a light and entertaining read if you can get beyond all of the reasons you should put it down and walk away.

The hero of the story, The Duke of Jervaulx, was excellently portrayed. You could easily feel his pain when he is forced into an asylum for the insane. However, the book's heroin, Maddy, was a bit out of control. A devout Quaker, she was torn between the life she always knew and the life with the Duke. While I really liked most of the characters, she just annoyed me to no end. Could she be more indecisive? The book eventually lacked closure with the secondary characters (the blind father and the former mistress) and should have resolved the books main issue of the Duke losing everything or not. For a 532-page book, it should have tied things up a bit neater instead of just the \"love conquers all\" typical ending.</td>\n",

Like any great compilation, this collection is a springboard into the world of 1960's Femme French Pop. The obvious is here with Brigitte Bardot but then there is also Jacqueline Taieb, the previously mentioned Marie Laforet and the Chinese/French Tiny Yong which will leave you begging for more, and more there is if you seek them out. The last track on the CD, La Pritemps a Paris by Jacqueline Taeb is unspeakably gorgeous and is worth the price of the CD in itself. Combined with novelty tracks like Dracula by Christine Pilzer this is a complete, precious introduction to 60's French Pop.</td>\n",

       "0     My lovely Pat has one of the GREAT voices of her generation. I have listened to this CD for YEARS and I still LOVE IT. When I'm in a good mood it makes me feel better. A bad mood just evaporates like sugar in the rain. This CD just oozes LIFE. Vocals are jusat STUUNNING and lyrics just kill. One of life's hidden gems. This is a desert isle CD in my book. Why she never made it big is just beyond me. Everytime I play this, no matter black, white, young, old, male, female EVERYBODY says one thing \"Who was that singing ?\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "1     Despite the fact that I have only played a small portion of the game, the music I heard (plus the connection to Chrono Trigger which was great as well) led me to purchase the soundtrack, and it remains one of my favorite albums. There is an incredible mix of fun, epic, and emotional songs. Those sad and beautiful tracks I especially like, as there's not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks. I must admit that one of the songs (Life-A Distant Promise) has brought tears to my eyes on many occasions.My one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs, which I find distracting. But even if those weren't included I would still consider the collection worth it.                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

If you are just starting to research law school, and do not know all the requirements of admission, then this book may be a tremendous help. If you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions, I recommend some more topic-specific books. For example, books on how to write your personal statment, books geared specifically towards LSAT preparation (Powerscore books were the most helpful for me), and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation. Yet, for those new to the entire affair, this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you.                                                                           \n",

       "24    If you purchase this data cable, you need to know that you will receive no real directions or information regarding what to check if nothing works. As directed, I downloaded all of the files from the SE site (70MB on dial up!), and then downloaded all of the user guides. Everything seemed to install ok, but nothing would make my phone be recognized. After that I scoured the SE site for troubleshooting info on their branded cable-in the hope that something would help me figure out the problem. After 2 full days of beating my head against the wall, I finally threw the cable and the useless CD that came with it in the trash.If I had used my brain I would have paid the extra $$ for a SE branded cable and software (and the support that comes along with that). I now have the real deal (SE data cable and software), and guess what? Yep, installation was a breeze and it works beautifully. You really do get what you pay for.   \n",

But I had it completely within the stated range and one basic house wall separating me and the unit, and it was completely unreliable.I'd recommend spending a touch more money and getting a higher quality product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "38    I had just finished reading 'The Food of Love' by Anthony Capella since I had nothing to do, but read. Mind you, reading is one of my favorite pastimes.I had recently bought a series of books. The Food of Love was just one of the books I just picked up so I can get that 'three for the price of two' deal at Waterstones in London (British's equivalent of Barnes&Noble;). I wasn't really interested, but it was one of the more interesting options I had. Well, I'm glad I made the right choice! I started reading it last night and I haven't put it down since.If you love food and a little romance, which I am both fond of, it's an excellent book to read. Mr. Capella was remarkably thorough in his description of the rich and textured Italian dishes that the words assails you with a sense of smell and taste that leaves you hungry for more. This book took me by surprise and I'm sure you would not be disappointed.                  \n",
       "39    A clichéd storyline based on the classic Cyrano de Bergerac, this book reads like a rookie novel written by someone who has a knowledge and passion for Italian culture and cuisine, but little experience in developing a story. I can understand Bruno and his passion for cooking, but have no clue as to his passion for Laura. It seems to be primarily based on her being a blonde American. How exotic. Her character is so underdeveloped- we know she's studying art history, and she enjoys Bruno's cooking with a passion. That's about it. And Tomasso, he's just the cliché for any over-sexed Mediterranean male who encounters foreign females.It's a light and entertaining read if you can get beyond all of the reasons you should put it down and walk away. That being said, I will, however, check out this author's more recent novels. He does seem to have a way with technical details, hopefully his storytelling has caught up.         \n",

       "42    This book is simply great! If you build sites for a living you probably struggle with books that trivialize HTML and present its syntax willy-nilly. This book is the ONLY book I've ever seen that actually seems to be written by someone who builds sites professionally and wants to know all the markup. It explains logical and physical tagging styles well and does a really good job showing how to hook HTML with other technologies without trying to teach CGI, CSS, etc. at the same time. The only thing I wish is that this guy would write a JavaScript or DHTML book. I'd buy that right away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "43    This is a tear-jerker mixed with humor. A lot of rough patches for this couple but don't let that scare you off because there are also a lot of good times, too.

I really didn't feel like the two main characters were in love, in fact the entire book was almost entirely from the heroine's point of view and I was getting sick of her whining and her point of view. unlike the \"dark\" series, you really didnt feel any passion. the book is better suited for the mystery/gothic genre and NOT romance.even the mystery was not that good! its only in the last chapter that for some unforseen reason the villain confesses all in less than three pages. throughout the entire book, you're kept in suspense of who was the bad guy, if you wanted to know who it was look at the last couple of pages....Ms. Feehan, if your reading, please focuse more on the main characters relation to each other rather then distract us with so much unamusing mystery!    \n",
       "47    I have read all of the Carpathian novels to date, except one. I very much enjoyed them at first, but nothing EVER gets resolved. You would think that after 16 books something would have been resolved and a new obstacle introduced. As for this book, it is an off-shoot of another Carpathian novel about the Jaguar Line. I was hoping to find out more about this curse, the origins and why the males kill the females. Nothing, not a word about the Jaguar curse. And why do the walls and ceilings change? Ideas introduced and left at that. Ms. Feehan went, once again, off on a tagent. Her books become less and less meaty and more and more expensive.

At first it wasn't so bad but then it became annoying because it then began flaking all over your skin and clothes.

       "9951  This was the first Elton John album I bought and it remains to this day my favorite. Yes, I had a vinyl album, and for some reason never moved to the cassette or CD. After buying this CD and singing along once again, I realized that it did indeed stand the test of time. Elton's melodies and piano-playing and Bernie Taupin's lyrics stand out. I know that \"Honky Chateau\" is considered by many to be a finer effort, but I just like every song on \"Don't Shoot Me\". In fact, several of the songs that weren't released as singles seem to me stronger efforts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

I chose Duane's Depressed after reading the back cover, and was incredibly impressed. I especially enjoyed the beginning chapters and the dialogue of the children. But I thought the novel faltered after the death of Karla, and the reasons for his not becoming involved with Honor were unusual and questionable. I also wondered why he desired to see Egypt, of all places. All in all, a wonderful novel, and I will continue to read McMurtry and follow Danny Deck in the sequels to All My Friends, but I was disappointed with the ending to this novel.                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

The first half of the book rolled along but the second half became unbearably slow. I felt like I was reading a character study by James Joyce.This book did not have the memorable characters characteristic of McMurtry novels. Imagine Lonesome Dove being a character study of Woodrow Call, it certainly would not win a Pulitzer. Maybe I prefer the Lonesome Dove saga better.

       "9968  This book could have been a great story and had the potential to be a real keeper to read over and over again. The premise was fantastic. However, the book just dragged on and on. The hero of the story, The Duke of Jervaulx, was excellently portrayed. You could easily feel his pain when he is forced into an asylum for the insane. However, the book's heroin, Maddy, was a bit out of control. A devout Quaker, she was torn between the life she always knew and the life with the Duke. While I really liked most of the characters, she just annoyed me to no end. Could she be more indecisive? The book eventually lacked closure with the secondary characters (the blind father and the former mistress) and should have resolved the books main issue of the Duke losing everything or not. For a 532-page book, it should have tied things up a bit neater instead of just the \"love conquers all\" typical ending.                              \n",

       "9972  I just purchased these towlettes based on multiple positive reviews. I had used L'Oreal's towlettes before and liked them, but everyone seemed to think these Comodynes were better. THEY ARE NOT. They don't smell bad, are easy to use, BUT they don't make you tanner! I have a dance competition coming up and now have to run out and try to find the L'Oreal product locally.

       "9973  After having this elliiptical trainer for several months I must say I am very dissapointed with this product and this company. After a month there was a problem with one of the pedals. I called the service line because it is under warranty and the company never answers calls. I was \"on hold\" waiting for the next availbale operator for over an hour. I finally decided to give up and leave a message and an operator did not get back to me two days! Finally after another week Merit did send a technician. The problem was fixed for about a month until the same problem reoccurred. I called Merit again, waited days for a call back, only to be told that my machine is no longer under warranty and would have to pay for all further repairs.This company has no customer service and their products are substandard.                                                                                                                          \n",

I am dissappointed as I was looking at the Radio flyer name since my son had a radio flyer when he was a kid maybe it would be a fun toy. It is not a toy even though it comes up under that heading.

       "9979  After hearing the debut album from Fischer's latest project Triptkon I thought wow I have to check out that Apollyon Sun side project and see what that was all about. I was psyched to find it for a mere two bits brand new from one of Amazon's Marketplace Sellers. I must admit I am glad that is all I paid for it. It just sounds like a poor White Zombie album to me. I think that Celtic Frost (especially the last line up) was top notch and Triptykon has a great future I believe. I know that this was a side project of Tom's and he admitted it was different from his normal style. I gave this one the 40 minute elliptical trainer test on my ITouch at the gym and it didn't keep me pumped although I still finished! I know some reviewers mentioned NIN and other bands that I have heard that this does sound more like and I realized I don't like those bands so I guess it's no surprise I didn't like this one either.                \n",

I spent the first half of the film waiting for some sort of plot to develop,and then I spent the second half of the film wishing it would end. Sharkboy doesn't say much in the movie at all except to unexpectedly yell at lava girl from time to time although they're supposed to be working together. Lava girl is an airhead and without any strong caharacters, and no real plot the movie seems to go in circles and circles and then finally has mercy on all of us viewers and ends. The 3-d was a great idea but I left with the feeling that some producers wanted to make a 3-d film and didn't bother actually writing a storyline before the actors started the movie. Do not subject yourself to this movie under any circumstanes!!!!                                                             \n",

Skip it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

I would take Marie Laforet over Mick Jagger any day and Patricia's Nights in White Satin would make any breathing human melt like butter on a French Riviera beach. Like any great compilation, this collection is a springboard into the world of 1960's Femme French Pop. The obvious is here with Brigitte Bardot but then there is also Jacqueline Taieb, the previously mentioned Marie Laforet and the Chinese/French Tiny Yong which will leave you begging for more, and more there is if you seek them out. The last track on the CD, La Pritemps a Paris by Jacqueline Taeb is unspeakably gorgeous and is worth the price of the CD in itself. Combined with novelty tracks like Dracula by Christine Pilzer this is a complete, precious introduction to 60's French Pop.                 \n",

I wouldn't                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "9997  My daughter loves this, she is six months old and we've had it for three weeks now and she is not tired of it. I put it in the kitchen and it is great while I am fixing dinner. She likes the sounds and can play with all of the toys herself without help. She can even turn the pages of the \"book\" and I had thought that would be too difficult. I completely recommend this product                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "9998  I purchased this item for my 6 month old baby and she loved it. It was entertaining for her and kept her busy as she turned herself to play with other items. Then about 2 weeks after buying it, one of the legs began to pop out and cause my baby to become unstable. We now constantly have to pop the leg back into place and it causes much distress for my baby. She will be playing fine and then the legs pops out and she loses her balance and becomes very unhappy. Unless I can get another leg that doesn't pop out, I doubt we will be using this much longer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "9999  My daughter started enjoying this around 4-1/2 months though she was too little to touch the ground and some of the toys at that time. However as she has grown...so too has she begun to realize all this toy has to offer. She particularly loves the animal sounds and songs. Her favorite is \"Old McDonald Had a Farm\" and she looks at me every time it plays because I sing it to her. She gets a real kick out of that and that...is pricess!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
